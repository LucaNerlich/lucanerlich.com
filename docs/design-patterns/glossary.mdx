# Glossary

## Abstraction

An interface or base type that hides implementation details.

## Cohesion

How strongly related the responsibilities of a module are. High cohesion is preferred.

## Coupling

The degree of dependency between modules. Lower coupling is preferred.

## Composition

Building behavior by combining objects rather than inheriting.

## Dependency injection

Supplying dependencies from the outside rather than creating them inside a class.

## Encapsulation

Hiding internal state and exposing controlled access through methods.

## Polymorphism

Using a common interface to work with different implementations.
