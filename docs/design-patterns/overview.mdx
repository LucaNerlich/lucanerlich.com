# Design Patterns Overview

This section collects GoF patterns with practical examples and guidance. Use it to pick a suitable pattern, not to force one.

## Quick decision guide

- **Object creation is complex** → look at **Creational** patterns.
- **You need to compose behavior** → look at **Structural** patterns.
- **You want flexible interactions** → look at **Behavioral** patterns.

## Common comparisons (quick picks)

- **Strategy vs State**: Strategy is chosen by the client; State changes from within the object.
- **Adapter vs Facade**: Adapter changes an interface; Facade simplifies a subsystem.
- **Decorator vs Proxy**: Decorator adds behavior; Proxy controls access.

## Pattern map (by intent)

| Intent | Patterns |
| --- | --- |
| Create one object | Singleton |
| Create families | Abstract Factory |
| Create step-by-step | Builder |
| Reuse similar objects | Prototype |
| Decouple creation | Factory Method |
| Adapt interfaces | Adapter |
| Simplify subsystems | Facade |
| Compose trees | Composite |
| Add behavior | Decorator |
| Control access | Proxy |
| Share state | Flyweight |
| Vary implementation | Bridge |
| Chain handlers | Chain of Responsibility |
| Encapsulate actions | Command |
| Define languages | Interpreter |
| Traverse collections | Iterator |
| Centralize communication | Mediator |
| Snapshot state | Memento |
| Notify observers | Observer |
| Switch behavior by state | State |
| Swap algorithms | Strategy |
| Fixed algorithm steps | Template Method |
| Add operations | Visitor |

## Next steps

- Start with the closest intent.
- Check “Related patterns” for alternatives.
- If two patterns fit, pick the simpler one.
