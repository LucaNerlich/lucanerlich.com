# Adobe Helix (Franklin)

Adobe Helix (also known as Franklin) is a document-driven CMS that focuses on fast authoring and performance. Content lives in SharePoint or Google Drive, and the website is generated from structured documents plus lightweight frontend code stored in GitHub.

## When to use Helix

- You want authoring directly in Word/Google Docs.
- Your site can be modeled as documents plus modular blocks.
- You want strong performance defaults with minimal backend work.

## How it works (high level)

1. Content is authored in SharePoint or Google Drive.
2. Content is transformed into HTML/Markdown by Helix services.
3. The site is rendered from GitHub-hosted frontend code and served via CDN.

## Project URLs

Preview URLs are constructed from the branch, repository name, and GitHub owner:

`https://{branch}--{repo}--{owner}.hlx.page/{path}`

Production URLs use the same pattern with `.hlx.live` or configured domains.

## Best practices

- Keep blocks small and predictable; avoid heavy DOM rewrites.
- Validate content structure early with strict block definitions.
- Review performance on every PR; avoid regressions in Core Web Vitals.
- Prefer progressive enhancement over large client-side bundles.
