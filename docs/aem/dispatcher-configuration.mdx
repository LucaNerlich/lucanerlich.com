# Dispatcher Configuration

Dispatcher is AEM's caching and request filtering layer. A good configuration improves performance and protects publish instances from unwanted traffic.

## Key files

- `dispatcher/src/conf.dispatcher.d/`
- `dispatcher/src/conf.d/`
- `dispatcher/src/dispatcher.any` (entry point)

## Core concepts

- **Filters**: allowlist requests you want to serve.
- **Cache rules**: define what is cached and how it is invalidated.
- **Client headers**: control forwarded headers for security.

## Best practices

- Default to deny in filters, then explicitly allow known paths.
- Keep cache invalidation rules tight to avoid over-flushing.
- Prefer allowlisted hosts for upstream requests.
- Validate changes against Cloud Manager dispatcher checks.
