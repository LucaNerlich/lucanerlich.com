# Performance

Performance in AEM is a combination of efficient components, stable content queries, and effective caching.

## Quick checklist

- Use Dispatcher caching and avoid unnecessary invalidations.
- Keep Sling Model logic lightweight.
- Use QueryBuilder and ensure indexes exist for heavy queries.
- Minimize clientlib payloads and defer non-critical scripts.
