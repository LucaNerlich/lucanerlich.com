# Replication and Activation

Replication moves content from author to publish. Activation is the standard operation for pushing content live.

## Core concepts

- **Activate**: publish content.
- **Deactivate**: remove content from publish.
- **Agents**: define where and how replication happens.

## Best practices

- Keep agent credentials scoped to minimal permissions.
- Avoid replicating sensitive or incomplete content.
- Monitor replication queues for failures.
