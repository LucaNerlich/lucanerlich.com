# AEM as a Cloud Service

AEM as a Cloud Service provides managed infrastructure, continuous updates, and a strict separation between code and content changes.

## What changes compared to on-prem

- Deployments go through Cloud Manager pipelines.
- Environments are immutable outside the pipeline.
- Configuration is code-driven via OSGi configs and runmodes.

## Practical tips

- Use the Cloud SDK for local validation.
- Keep dispatcher rules minimal and validate them in pipeline checks.
- Treat author and publish as distinct targets with separate configs.
