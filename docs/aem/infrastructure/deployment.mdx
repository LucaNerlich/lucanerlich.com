# Deployment

For AEM as a Cloud Service, deployments are handled through Cloud Manager pipelines. For on-prem or managed services, deployments are usually package-based with additional operational checks.

## Typical pipeline steps

1. Build and unit test
2. Package validation and static analysis
3. Dispatcher validation (Cloud Service)
4. Deploy to author and publish

## Best practices

- Keep packages small and focused.
- Avoid content mutations in code deployments unless necessary.
- Validate dispatcher rules before promotion.
