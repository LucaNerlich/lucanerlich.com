# Adobe Edge Delivery Services

Adobe Helix is now branded as **Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS)**. It is a modern content delivery framework that optimizes for speed, simplicity, and scale while staying tightly integrated with AEM as a Cloud Service. It enables fast authoring and delivery by pushing rendering and delivery closer to the edge and by using a frontend-first workflow. [Overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/de/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/overview)

## What it is

Edge Delivery Services is part of AEM and provides a composable, frontend-focused way to build and deliver sites. It replaces the traditional Publish/Dispatcher model with a multi-cloud SaaS delivery approach and integrates with your CDN or Adobe’s managed CDN. [Overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/de/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/overview)

## Why use it

- **Performance by default** with edge-optimized rendering.
- **Faster development** with GitHub-driven workflows and lightweight frontend code.
- **Flexible authoring** via AEM’s universal editor or document-based editing.

## Authoring options

1. **AEM Authoring + Universal Editor** for visual, in-context editing.
2. **Document-based authoring** using SharePoint or Google Drive and publishing from familiar tools. [Overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/de/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/overview)

## How it works (high level)

1. Content is authored in AEM or document sources (SharePoint/Google Drive).
2. Content is transformed and delivered via Edge Delivery Services.
3. Frontend code is managed in GitHub and served globally at the edge. [Overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/de/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/overview)

## Getting started

If you want to start quickly, the official guidance points to using a preconfigured tutorial environment or setting up your own environment in less than 30 minutes. [Overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/de/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/overview)

## Best practices

- Keep blocks small and predictable; avoid heavy DOM rewrites.
- Validate content structure early with strict block definitions.
- Review performance on every PR; avoid regressions in Core Web Vitals.
- Prefer progressive enhancement over large client-side bundles.
