# Testing

Testing in AEM usually combines unit tests for backend logic, integration tests for content and services, and UI tests for authoring behavior.

## What to cover

- **Unit tests**: Sling Models, services, and utilities.
- **Integration tests**: Repository interactions and OSGi configs.
- **UI tests**: Authoring flows and component dialogs.

## Practical tips

- Prefer fast unit tests for business logic.
- Keep integration tests focused on content structure and permissions.
- Smoke-test authoring scenarios before releases.
