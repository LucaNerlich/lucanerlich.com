# Security Basics

These are general AEM security guidelines that apply across author, publish, and custom code.

## Core principles

- Least privilege for users and service accounts.
- Validate input and avoid dynamic code execution.
- Keep secrets out of the repository.

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- Exposing custom `/bin` endpoints without authentication or CSRF protection.
- Overly broad dispatcher allowlists.
- Granting `admin` permissions to service users.
