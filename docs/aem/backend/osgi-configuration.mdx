# OSGi Configuration

OSGi configuration is the primary way to control AEM services across environments. In AEM projects, configs are stored in the repository and deployed as part of the codebase.

## Where configs live

- `ui.config/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/<app>/osgiconfig/`
- Use runmode folders such as `config.author`, `config.publish`, and `config.dev` for environment-specific values.

## File naming

- Single config: `com.example.MyService.cfg.json`
- Factory config: `com.example.MyService~my-name.cfg.json`

## Example

```json title="ui.config/.../config.author/com.example.MyService.cfg.json"
{
  "enabled": true,
  "maxItems": 100,
  "endpoint": "https://api.example.com"
}
```

## Best practices

- Keep secrets out of the repository; use secret stores or environment-specific injection.
- Prefer small, focused configurations per service.
- Use runmodes to keep author and publish behavior aligned with security requirements.
