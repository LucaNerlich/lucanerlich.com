# Design Patterns Docs Plan

## Scope

- Create a new top-level docs category `docs/design-patterns/` with one page per GoF pattern.
- Provide mixed Java + TypeScript examples, pros/cons, and usage guidance for each pattern.

## Structure

- Add category metadata at [docs/design-patterns/_category_.json](docs/design-patterns/_category_.json) with a generated index.
- Create subfolders for each group:
- [docs/design-patterns/creational/](docs/design-patterns/creational/)
- [docs/design-patterns/structural/](docs/design-patterns/structural/)
- [docs/design-patterns/behavioral/](docs/design-patterns/behavioral/)

## Page Template

Each pattern page will follow the same structure:

- Overview
- When to use
- Java example
- TypeScript example
- Pros and cons
- Common pitfalls
- Related patterns

## Files to Add

- 24 pages (one per GoF pattern) under the three subfolders.
- Examples:
- [docs/design-patterns/creational/singleton.mdx](docs/design-patterns/creational/singleton.mdx)
- [docs/design-patterns/structural/adapter.mdx](docs/design-patterns/structural/adapter.mdx)
- [docs/design-patterns/behavioral/strategy.mdx](docs/design-patterns/behavioral/strategy.mdx)

## Navigation

- Ensure sidebars are autogenerated so the new category appears in the main docs navigation.
- Use `sidebar_position` in each pattern file for stable ordering by pattern group.

## Quality Pass

- Verify internal links and headings are consistent across all pages.
- Ensure Java + TypeScript examples compile logically and match the text.
